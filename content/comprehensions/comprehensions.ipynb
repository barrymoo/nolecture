    "In \"2.\" of the previous question we had to build a list prior to the loop. We could have also used `c = []` and `c.append(x + y)`, but note that `append` is an extremely slow function. Python also provides some syntactic sugar for this case, e.g.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "This is extremely terse and readable. This is called a \"List Comprehension\" and is probably my favorite Python feature. You can also append filter clauses! e.g.\n",

    "#### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the `songs` and `artists`, create the following dictionaries:\n",
    "    - keys: songs, values: artists, only if the artist has an `n` in the name\n",
    "2. Create a list that contains the cubes divided by the squares in the range [1, 10) only if the division is divisible by 2\n",
    "    - Note: you likely already have `square` and `cube` defined as anonymous functions!\n",
    "    - Predefine the range! i.e. `vals = range(<something>)`\n",
    "3. What function would you need to make \"2.\" a dictionary with the index as the key? You are welcome to try this, but the hard work is already done :)"
